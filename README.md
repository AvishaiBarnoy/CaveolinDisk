# Caveolin-1 in Caveolae simulation
## About
2D simulation of caveolin-1 on caveolae surface

## Description
caveolin is modelled as a disk and are connected to each other by membrane.
Differnet combination of connectiong between neighborig caveolin are computed, and the geometry is minimized with respect to an ideal angle between edges.

## How to use
To be added in the future

## Thanks
Thanks for Itai Knaan-Harpaz for the algorithm for the initial geometry
